In this assignment I got to familiarize more with the process of building a hash table with using a linked list. Comparing to other assignments I think what went well this time was implementing a "Main.java" page - now deleted - While in COMP 170 having a main helped learn where to find my mistakes or to see how my outcomes would appear, this is a method I plan on using not in just the rest of these course but also moving forward with my career as a coder as well.
